# CSCI-325-Program
This is a repository for my CSCI 325 program that I am submitting as part of my Senior Portfolio.

### Program Information
This program allows two users to play a game of Checkers against each other.

### How To Compile/Run
This program has been written in Java and compiled using javac. The four compiled files have been put into a release. The best way to run this program would be to download the latest release, and run java Main. Also, the source code could be downloaded, recompiled, and then ran in a different way.
